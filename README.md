# Morality Through Familiar Eyes: How Moral Convictions and Repeated Exposure Influence Cognitive Function

Welcome to the repository of this research project by Abdulaziz AlHothi. 

## Project Abstract

Moral convictions—deeply held beliefs about right and wrong—are typically considered rigid and resistant to change, often driven by intuitive emotional responses rather than deliberative reasoning. However, psychological research suggests that repeated exposure to stimuli enhances familiarity, which can, in turn, shape attitudes and cognitive processing. This study investigates the role of familiarity as a potential mechanism influencing moral convictions, with a specific focus on how repeated exposure to socio-political issues modulates attention and decision-making. Using an eye-tracking paradigm, participants completed a decision-making task in which they selected between two protest-related images, each associated with a socio-political issue that varied in familiarity and moral conviction intensity. Fixation duration, a key measure of cognitive engagement, was analyzed to determine whether highly familiar and morally charged topics reduce deliberative processing. Statistical analyses, including mixed-effects models and ANOVA, revealed that higher familiarity with a topic significantly predicted stronger moral conviction, supporting the hypothesis that exposure reinforces intuitive moralization. Additionally, familiarity and moral conviction were found to negatively predict fixation duration, suggesting that these factors decrease attention allocation, potentially bypassing cognitive scrutiny. These findings highlight the cognitive effects of exposure-driven familiarity on moral attitudes, contributing to a deeper understanding of how repeated interactions with socio-political content influence moral judgment. The implications of this research extend to digital media consumption, political polarization, and strategies for promoting critical thinking in moral discourse.
